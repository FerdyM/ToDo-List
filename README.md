# ToDo-List 

This project is literal pure innovation... haha just kidding this is just a basic ToDoList Application, it's a pretty nice ToDoList however!

This project is just an easy way for me to show skills in RESTful api's, MERN, and super basic authentication and authorization. Im not a great designer but in my opinion it turned out alright thanks to material-ui!

Feel free to reach out with any feedback it's more than appreciated!
